      "Your secrets are safe with me. I never even listen when you tell me them.",
      "You're like a software update. Whenever I see you, I hit 'remind me later.'",
      "You're like a web page that takes forever to load... useless and frustrating.",
      "I'd agree with you, but then weâ€™d both be wrong.",
      "You're not stupid; you just have bad luck thinking.",
      "If I had a penny for every time you said something smart, Iâ€™d be broke.",
      "Your brain's on vacation, but your mouth is working overtime.",
      "You're like a broken pencil... pointless.",
      "Iâ€™d explain it to you, but I left my English-to-Dingbat dictionary at home.",
      "You bring everyone so much joy when you leave the room.",
      "You're like a cloud on a sunny day, blocking all the good vibes.",
      "If I had a nickel for every dumb thing you said, I could retire early.",
      "You're like a phone with no signal: completely useless.",
      "Iâ€™ve seen salads dressed better than you.",
      "You're like a slinkyâ€”worthless, but fun to push down the stairs.",
      "If you were any more clueless, youâ€™d be a GPS.",
      "You're the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard.",
      "You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, but youâ€™re still a tool.",
      "Iâ€™d call you a tool, but that would be an insult to the tool.",
      "You're like a software bug: nobody knows how you got here, but now we all have to deal with you.",
      "If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person alive.",
      "Iâ€™d say youâ€™re one in a million, but that would imply thereâ€™s at least one other like you.",
      "You're like a phone with a cracked screenâ€”hard to look at and even harder to use.",
      "You have the right to remain silent because whatever you say will be used against you.",
      "You're like an overcooked steakâ€”tough, dry, and hard to chew on.",
      "Youâ€™re the human equivalent of a participation trophy.",
      "You're like a mystery novelâ€”no one can figure you out, and everyoneâ€™s better off without you.",
      "If I wanted your opinion, Iâ€™d ask someone else.",
      "You're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but youâ€™re definitely the dullest.",
      "You're like a browser tab with 50 open windowsâ€”chaotic and not productive.",

      "If I wanted to hear something as unoriginal as your ideas, Iâ€™d just listen to elevator music.",
      "Youâ€™re like a traffic jamâ€”no one knows why you're here, but we're all stuck with you.",
      "You couldnâ€™t pour water out of a boot if the instructions were on the heel.",
      "Iâ€™d try to explain it to you, but I'm afraid I'd be overestimating your intellectual capacity.",
      "You're like a Wi-Fi password thatâ€™s too long to remember.",
      "Your thoughts are like a lightbulbâ€”they go out more than they come on.",
      "You're like a fire alarm in the middle of the nightâ€”loud and unnecessary.",
      "If you were any more transparent, youâ€™d be invisible.",
      "You're like a homework assignmentâ€”always delayed and never done right.",
      "You remind me of a cloud with no silver lining.",
      "Youâ€™re like an app with no updatesâ€”stuck in the past.",
      "You're the human equivalent of a pop-up ad.",
      "You're like a pencil without leadâ€”totally pointless.",
      "You're like an expired couponâ€”no longer of any value.",
      "Youâ€™re like a car without a GPSâ€”always lost, but still moving forward.",
      "Youâ€™re proof that even the best of us can have a bad dayâ€¦ every day.",
      "Your sense of direction is as lost as your common sense.",
      "If being wrong was a sport, youâ€™d be a gold medalist.",
      "You're like a mystery meat at a school cafeteriaâ€”no oneâ€™s sure what you are, and no one wants to find out.",
      "Your logic is so skewed, you could teach a course on how not to think.",
      "Youâ€™re like a black holeâ€”everything good just gets sucked out of the room when you show up.",
      "Your ideas are like a bad movieâ€”predictable and not worth watching.",
      "You're like a car with a flat tireâ€”stuck, useless, and annoying to deal with.",
      "You couldnâ€™t spell â€˜smartâ€™ if your life depended on it.",
      "You have the same effect as a broken pencilâ€”pointless and frustrating.",
      "You're like a malfunctioning robotâ€”awkward and no longer useful.",
      "Youâ€™re the reason â€˜dumbâ€™ is a word in the dictionary.",
      "You're like a Wi-Fi connection that drops every 5 minutesâ€”unpredictable and unreliable.",
      "Youâ€™re a couple of fries short of a happy meal.",
      "Youâ€™re a one-person circus act, and everyoneâ€™s tired of the show.",
      "If I had a dime for every time you made me laugh, Iâ€™d be broke from all the pain.",
      "You're the kind of person who'd forget their own reflection if it wasn't for the mirror.",
